Objective:
The objective of the game is to select three numbers from the game board such that they can be used to calculate the current token number displayed. The calculation should follow these rules:
- Multiply or divide the first two selected numbers.
- Add or subtract the third selected number to/from the result of the first operation to match the current token number.

Game Play:
1. Start the Game: When you start the game, the game board is populated with numbers and the first token number is displayed.
2. Select Numbers: Click on three numbers on the board in a sequence that satisfies the objective. The selected numbers are highlighted.
3. Validation: Once three numbers are selected:
   - If the numbers meet the criteria, a message of success is displayed, and the next token number is generated.
   - If the selection does not meet the criteria, a message prompts you to try again.
4. Skip Option: If you're stuck, you can choose to skip the current token. This counts as a skipped token and the next token number is generated.
5. Reset Game: At any point, you can reset the game to start over.

Points and Progress:
- Points are awarded based on correct solutions.
- The game tracks the number of tokens you have completed and skipped.

Ending the Game:
The game ends when all tokens have been either solved or skipped. A summary of your performance, including points scored, tokens completed, and tokens skipped, is displayed. You can choose to play again to improve your score.

Tips:
- Try different combinations of operations. Sometimes, more than one combination can solve the puzzle.
- Use the skip button sparingly. Skipping reduces the potential total score.

This manual provides all the necessary instructions and rules to help players understand and enjoy the game.
